This guide explains step-by-step how to unstake a [locking position](overview#locking-positions) before it has expired.

:::warning
Early unstaking involves a **penalty fee**.

The penalty fee is calculated based on the remaining duration of the locking position and the amount of LSK being unstaked.
The penalty fee is deducted from the LSK being unstaked.

If you simply want to unstake normally, please refer to the guide on [How to unstake](stake-unstake#how-to-unstake-your-lsk-tokens).

For more details check [Early Unlock](overview#early-unlock).
:::

1. Go to your [Staking Dashboard](https://portal.lisk.com/staking/dashboard) in the Lisk Portal.
    Connect your wallet if you haven't already.
2. In the list of your locking positions, click on the locking position you wish to unstake early, to expand it.

    :::
3. Click on the `Early Unlock` button.
4. Confirm you understand the consequences of early unstaking.
    Review the amount of LSK you will receive after the penalty fee is deducted.
