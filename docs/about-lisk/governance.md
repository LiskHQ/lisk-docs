# Governance

At the moment, the security of the Lisk Mainnet is dependent on a [multisig wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/) managed by several individuals of the Onchain Foundation.
This multisig wallet can be used to upgrade core Lisk Mainnet smart contracts without upgrade delays.

To decentralize the governance of the Lisk project further, Lisk introduces a decentralized autonomous organization, the Lisk DAO, which allows Lisk token holders to participate together in the governance of the Lisk project.

## Lisk DAO
The Lisk DAO provides multiple opportunities for LSK token holders to participate in the overall governance of the Lisk project, including:

- Allocation of funds
- Protocol updates
- Strategic directions

### Funding proposals
A proposal for receiving a certain amount of funds to an address. If approved, the recipient receives the amount given in the proposal. The transfer from the Lisk DAO treasury can be executed by anyone, once the proposal is approved. Funding proposals are binding, which means that no-one, not even the Onchain Foundation, can prevent the transfer, if the proposal passed.
### General proposals
Generic, non-binding proposals about protocol parameters or the project direction in general that may be followed by the Lisk Foundation or not, depending also on feasibility and cost.

## Administrative role of the foundation
The foundation will have an administrative role and will take care of the following

1. Removal of draft proposals that reasonably appear to be fraudulent, spam-oriented, defamatory, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate.
2. Management of mutually contradictory proposals that are submitted simultaneously or in close proximity to one another.
3. Administration of network maintenance, such as emergency bug fixes or release rollbacks (with or without a governance vote).

## Implementation of proposals
For approved general proposals, the foundation will determine whether the proposal is safe, secure, consistent with the scope of Lisk governance, and capable of being implemented in a legally compliant manner. If it is, the Foundation will act diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner to cause the proposal to be implemented.

## Governance Goals
There are two primary goals of Lisks governance system:

### Capture resistance
Governance plays a key role in securing the anti-capture and censorship resistance of the Lisk protocol. Governance should:

1. make it possible for the chain or network operations to continue without reliance on any individual entity, and 
2. prevent any one entity or small group of entities from being able to control or censor the protocol or its functions.

### Resource allocation
Governance’s second primary responsibility is to allocate resources effectively to support the Lisks vision and accrue sustainable value to the Lisk DAO. Vision & value may often be in conflict, and allocating resources effectively involves a blend of short- and long-term thinking. This includes allocation of both the token treasury and protocol revenue.

## Design Principles
Design decisions for Lisks governance system should be made in line with three key principles:

### Governance minimization
The set of governance responsibilities that are encoded onchain or formalized in voting processes should remain as minimal as possible. The Lisk DAO aims to reduce governance to its essence and to avoid introducing regulation where freedom can achieve the same result. This principle is key to encouraging permissionless innovation. In practice, this looks like a minimal set of:
1. onchain governance processes to upgrade Lisk contracts and tune the economic parameters of the system, and
2. offchain social processes to maintain a healthy community.

### Iteration
Lisk is decentralizing iteratively to increase the chances of building a healthy system that lasts for the long-term. This means the Foundation will play a role in establishing processes, help the DAO through its first few rapid feedback loops in improving those processes, then reduce its role over time. (This also means the design principles and goals outlined in this document may be invalidated or updated along the way.) This iteration gives the DAO a chance to learn how to make thoughtful decisions using an un-intuitive but essential loop: introduce a governance process that involves active participation, then gradually work to automate or minimize it over time. Governance’s responsibility then becomes to adjust the autopilot when necessary, not to keep two hands on the wheel.

### Forking 
The ability to fork and the ability to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms.  All of the core software and tooling required to run the Lisk network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative. This isn’t just about vibes: in crypto, where credible commitments not to extract are what makes decentralized platforms valuable, this is a competitive advantage. Participants will be more likely to join Lisk if they have the ability to make an alternative.
