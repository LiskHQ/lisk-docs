# Governance

At the moment, the security of the Lisk Mainnet is dependent on a [multisig wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/) managed by several key members involved in the Lisk project.
This multisig wallet can be used to upgrade core Lisk Mainnet smart contracts without upgrade delays.

To decentralize the governance of the Lisk project further, Lisk introduces a decentralized autonomous organization, the Lisk DAO, which allows Lisk token holders to participate together in the governance of the Lisk project.

:::info
Every LSK token holder who participates in the DAO is rewarded with [staking rewards](#staking-rewards), to incentivize participation in the Lisk governance.
:::

## Lisk DAO
The Lisk DAO provides the opportunity for LSK token holders to participate in the overall governance of the Lisk project, including allocation of funds, protocol updates, or strategic directions.
Decisions are made via [proposals](#proposals).

### Tools
The following are the main tools to participate in the Lisk DAO:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="tally" label="Tally">
  Tally is the platform used to create and vote for proposals of the Lisk DAO.

  {/* TODO: Update link to tally instance */}
  {/* The [Lisk DAO Tally instance](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/3rd-testing) is the place where users can vote on proposals or delegate their voting power. */}
  The Lisk DAO Tally instance is the place where users can vote on proposals or delegate their voting power.
  It will be available once the Lisk DAO is launched.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="forum" label="Forum">
  The [Lisk Governance Forum](https://forum.lisk.com/) is the place for the community to discuss the Lisk governance and draft proposals, before they are submitted on Tally.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="discord" label="Discord">
  The `#lisk-dao` channel in the [Lisk Chat](https://lisk.chat) Discord server is a community chat dedicated to discuss topics all around the Lisk DAO, share news and updates, or share ideas for new proposals.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Treasury
The Lisk DAO has an associated treasury, which resides in the [Timelock contract](https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com/address/0x4b727D3f74DD4c124Ced030335DebD5e7EBB8366).
The current balance of the treasury can be checked on the [Lisk BlockScout Explorer](https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com/address/0x4b727D3f74DD4c124Ced030335DebD5e7EBB8366).
{/* TODO: Update link to timelock contract */}
{/* The Lisk DAO has an associated treasury, which resides in the [Timelock contract](https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com/address/0x4b727D3f74DD4c124Ced030335DebD5e7EBB8366).

The treasury is NOT managed by the Onchain Foundation.
Instead, the funds from the treasury can only be transferred via successful [funding proposals](#proposal-types).

Tokens for the Lisk DAO fund are minted newly and added to the Lisk DAO according to the following vesting plan:

| Year | Amount (LSK) | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 2024 | 15,000,000 | 6,250,000 LSK liquid at migration, 8,750,000 LSK are linearly released in 2024, starting from the migration. |
| 2025 | 15,000,000 | LSK are linearly released over the year. |
| 2026 | 15,000,000 | LSK are linearly released over the year. |

:::note
The DAO fund may be increased further in the future by an additional 100,000,000 LSK over the following 7 years if the DAO members approve the corresponding proposals.
:::

### Voting power
Every account holding **LSK** is able **stake/lock** a specific amount of LSK tokens to get some voting power and [staking rewards](#staking-rewards).

This works as follows:

- Users can stake tokens for a specific locking duration (between 2 weeks and 2 years).
- Users receive voting power and staking rewards proportional to the amount of locked tokens.
- After the locking duration ends, the users can redeem their tokens.

{/* TODO: Uncomment once staking is implemented */}
{/* Staking happens on the [Lisk portal](https://portal.lisk.com/). */}

Initially, the voting power of a locked token will be constant during its locking duration.
But it is possible to [boost the voting power](#boosting-the-voting-power) by up to 200% where the boost is proportional to the remaining locking duration.

#### Voting power calculation
Locked tokens provide a voting power proportional to the amount of locked tokens. Concretely, 1 locked LSK provides one unit of voting power.

##### Boosting the voting power
Users have the option to pause the countdown of the locking period.
That means, the counting towards the end of the locking period is paused until the user decides to resume it.
In the case of pausing, the user receives a boost of the voting power. It is set to `lockedAmount * (1 + remainingLockingDurationInDays/365)`.
Hence, the voting power can be increased by up to 200%.

### Delegation
The Governor framework requires **delegating the voting power** in order to use it.
The voting power can be delegated to other users or to yourself.
Self-delegation is a requirement if you want to vote on your own.

Delegation happens on [Tally](#tools).

#### Importance of delegation
Delegation is a key feature of the Lisk DAO, as it allows token holders to participate in the governance of the Lisk project passively by entrusting a representative to vote on proposals in a way that aligns with their own beliefs and values.
By delegating their voting power to a delegate of their choice, token holders can ensure that their interests are represented in the decision-making process.
However, token holders give a lot of power to the delegate to make the right decisions on proposals.

This is why it is important to choose a delegate that you trust and that you believe will act in the best interest of the Lisk project and the community.
We recommend to choose a delegate that is active in the community, has a good reputation, and has a track record of making good decisions.

The following sources might support you in your delegation decision:

- [Lisk Chat](https://lisk.chat): Get in touch with your delegate in the Lisk chat, or ask other users about their experiences with the delegate.
- [Lisk Governance Forum](https://forum.lisk.com/c/delegates/): The Lisk Governance Forum provides a section for delegates to present themselves to the community.
- **Lisk DAO Tally instance**: Check the delegate's profile, voting history and activity on the Lisk DAO Tally instance.
{/* TODO: Uncomment link on DAO launch */}
{/* - [Lisk DAO Tally instance](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/3rd-testing): */}

#### How to delegate your voting power

The Lisk DAO uses Tally to facilitate delegation. 

The process in a nutshell:

1. Connect your wallet to Tally and navigate to the Lisk DAO page.
2. Select the "delegate" button.
3. Search for the delegate you'd like to delegate your voting power to and confirm the delegation by following Tally's prompts.

:::tip
Through Tally, you can change or revoke your delegation at any time. 

You can also proportionally delegate your voting power to multiple delegates. 
:::

#### Responsibility of delegates
Delegates play a crucial role in the governance of the Lisk project.
They are the ones who create proposals, vote on behalf of the token holders, and represent the interests of the community as a whole.

Delegates are required to:

- Follow the processes outlined in the Governance documentation of the Lisk DAO
- Act in the best interest of the token holders whom they represent
- Be active in the decision-making process of the DAO, this means specifically:
  - Vote on proposals
  - Create proposals
  - Give feedback on other draft proposals

#### Benefits of being a delegate

- **Impact**: 
  - Have influence on the direction of the Lisk project.
  - Decide directly about fund allocation of the Lisk DAO treasury.
  {/* TODO: Confirm rewards */}
{/* - **Rewards**:
  - Being a delegate is required for some LSK air drops.
  - Being a delegate can be benefitial e.g. when applying for the Grant or Ambassador programs.
  - Receive extra rewards for being an excellent delegate (e.g., being most active/constructive, having most delegations, etc). */}
- **Reputation**:
  - Gain reputation by being a delegate.

{/* TODO: Create guide */}
{/* For more information, check the guide on [How to delegate your voting power] */}

#### How to become a delegate

Basically anyone who owns some LSK tokens can become a delegate.

You simply need to stake some LSK tokens and then self-delegate your [voting power](#voting-power).
However, in order to create proposals, a delegate must have at least 300,000 vpLSK.

If you wish to increase your voting power, to have more influence on votings, or to be able to create your own proposals, it is possible to get delegations from other users.
There are various ways to do this:

1. Fill out your delegate profile on Tally.
Token holders will be able to see your profile and decide whether to delegate their voting power to you, so make sure to provide a detailed description of yourself and your intentions.
2. Present yourself to the community in the Lisk Governance Forum.
The Lisk Governance Forum provides a category for delegates to present themselves to the community.
Here it is also possible for token holders to ask questions and get to know you better.
Additionally, it might be beneficial to join the `#lisk-dao` channel in the [Lisk Chat](https://lisk.chat) Discord server to get in touch with the community.
3. Actively participate in the governance process.
This includes voting on proposals, creating proposals, and giving feedback on other draft proposals.


### Proposals
Proposals are created on [Tally](#tools).
For spam protection, the following requirement must be fulfilled in order to create a proposal:

- **Proposal threshold**: For creating a proposal, the voting power of the proposer must be at least 300,000 vpLSK, i.e., the value corresponding to 100,000 LSK locked for 2 years where the countdown is paused.

#### Proposal types

| Type        | Description   | Binding?      |
| :---------- |:------------- |:------------- |
| **Funding** | A proposal for receiving a certain amount of funds to an address. If approved, the recipient receives the amount given in the proposal. | Yes|
| **General** |  General proposals about protocol parameters or the project direction in general that may be followed by the Onchain Foundation or not, depending also on feasibility and cost.  | No  |

#### Proposal evaluation
The following requirements must be fulfilled for a proposal to pass:

- **Quorum**: For a proposal to pass, the “yes” and “abstain” votes must sum up at least to 24,000,000 vpLSK, i.e., the value that corresponds to 8,000,000 LSK locked for 2 years where the countdown is paused.
- There must be strictly more “yes” than “no” votes.

#### Implementation of funding proposals
The transfer from the [Lisk DAO treasury](#treasury) can be executed by anyone, once a funding proposal is approved.
Funding proposals are **binding**, which means that no one, not even the Onchain Foundation, can prevent the transfer if the proposal passes.
#### Implementation of general proposals
For approved general proposals, the Onchain Foundation will determine whether the proposal is safe, secure, consistent with the scope of Lisk governance, and capable of being implemented in a legally compliant manner.
If it is, the Foundation will act diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner to cause the proposal to be implemented.

### Administrative role of the Onchain Foundation
The foundation will have an administrative role and will take care of the following

1. Removal of draft proposals that reasonably appear to be fraudulent, spam-oriented, defamatory, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate.
2. Management of mutually contradictory proposals that are submitted simultaneously or in close proximity to one another.
3. Administration of network maintenance, such as emergency bug fixes or release rollbacks (with or without a governance vote).

### Staking rewards
Staking rewards incentivize users to participate in governance, making the decision making more decentralized and community-driven.  
In short, users get [voting power](#voting-power) and rewards for locking/staking tokens for a specific time period.

The Lisk DAO applies a **time-weight boosting** on rewards:
The further the end of the locking duration is in the future, the more rewards you get.
This also implies that the rewards decrease every day.
This way, we reward token holders for committing long-term to the Lisk project so we attract them as long-term advocates for Lisk while reducing short-term speculation and volatility. 

- Users can modify their locking positions (increase amount, extend/pause locking duration) at any time they want.
- Users can claim their rewards at any time.   
- Users have the option to **pause** their locking period countdown.
That means, the remaining locking duration remains fixed until the user decides to resume it.
Note that this results in **higher staking rewards**, since the weight remains fixed, as opposed to a weight daily decreasing when the countdown is active. 

#### Staking rewards distribution
{/* TODO: 
- Add Blockscout link to address of the Staking contract 
- Update contract overview link, once the repository is public
*/}
{/* Rewards are taken from the balance of the [Rewards contract](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-contracts-private/blob/main/documentation/staking-governance.md#contracts-overview) and calculated daily, based on the amount locked and the remaining locking duration. */}
Rewards are taken from the balance of the Rewards contract and calculated daily, based on the amount locked and the remaining locking duration.
Concretely, the weight for a locked amount is given by `lockedAmount * (remainingLockingDurationInDays + 150)`.
The total daily amount of staking rewards, 8,000,000 / 365  LSK, is then shared by all users proportional to their weight.

We plan to use a total of 24 million LSK tokens over the course of 3 years for the LSK staking rewards program (8 million LSK per year).
After the end of this 3-year span, we expect that developments in the Optimism Superchain Ecosystem (shared, decentralized sequencers) will lead us to a new staking mechanism.

However, even in case the current staking mechanism has to be continued, extra funding could be provided; potential sources are: 

1. Unclaimed LSK tokens 
2. The staking rewards of the Onchain Foundation, which would be provided to the ecosystem and
3. The profit of the Onchain Foundation from sequencing rewards. 

{/* ## Governance goals
There are two primary goals of Lisks governance system:

### Capture resistance
Governance plays a key role in securing the anti-capture and censorship resistance of the Lisk protocol.
Governance should:

1. make it possible for the chain or network operations to continue without reliance on any individual entity, and 
2. prevent any one entity or small group of entities from being able to control or censor the protocol or its functions.

### Resource allocation
Governance’s second primary responsibility is to allocate resources effectively to support the Lisks vision and accrue sustainable value to the Lisk DAO.
Vision & value may often be in conflict, and allocating resources effectively involves a blend of short- and long-term thinking.

## Design principles
Design decisions for Lisk's governance system should be made in line with three key principles:

### Governance minimization
The set of governance responsibilities that are encoded onchain or formalized in voting processes should remain as minimal as possible.
The Lisk DAO aims to reduce governance to its essence and to avoid introducing regulation where freedom can achieve the same result.
This principle is key to encouraging permissionless innovation.
In practice, this looks like a minimal set of:

1. onchain governance processes ([binding](#implementation-of-funding-proposals) and non-binding) to upgrade Lisk contracts or allocate funds, and
2. offchain social processes to maintain a healthy community.

### Iteration
Lisk is decentralizing iteratively to increase the chances of building a healthy system that lasts for the long term.
This means the Foundation will play a role in establishing processes, help the DAO through its first few rapid feedback loops in improving those processes, then reduce its role over time.
(This also means the design principles and goals outlined in this document may be invalidated or updated along the way.)
This iteration gives the DAO a chance to learn how to make thoughtful decisions using an un-intuitive but essential loop: introduce a governance process that involves active participation, then gradually work to automate or minimize it over time.
Governance’s responsibility then becomes to adjust the autopilot when necessary, not to keep two hands on the wheel.

### Forking 
The ability to fork and the ability to exit are critical to protect individual freedoms.
All of the core software and tooling required to run the Lisk network should be made open source, freely available, and easy to use such that a fork is always a viable alternative.
Participants will be more likely to join Lisk if they have the ability to make an alternative.
