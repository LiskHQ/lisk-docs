# Claiming LSK tokens

Everyone who held tokens on the Lisk L1 chain is entitled to claim the exact same amount of LSK on Lisk L2.
This guide explains step-by-step, how to complete the claiming process.

:::info
Lisk token holders have a **2-year window starting May 21st, 2024** to claim and migrate their tokens to Lisk L2.
:::

## Requirements

To claim your LSK tokens on Lisk L2, you need the following:

1. An account on the Lisk L1 legacy chain, with some LSK tokens.
  The account must hold some LSK tokens at the snapshot height `24,823,618`.
  The amount of LSK tokens you can claim on Lisk L2 is the same as the amount you held on Lisk L1 at the snapshot height.
2. Latest version of the [Lisk Migration Wallet](https://lisk.com/wallet) installed (3.0.3)
3. An account on Lisk L2 with a small amount of ETH, to pay for the gas fees.
  If you need to bridge ETH tokens from Ethereum to Lisk, please refer to one of the available [bridges](/lisk-chain/lisk-tools/bridges).
4. If you have a Ledger hardware wallet, you need the latest version of the Lisk app installed (Lisk legacy 4.0.0).
