# Deploying a smart contract with thirdweb
[thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) is an end-to-end framework for smart contract development and deployment.

It enables developers to deploy, standard contracts such as ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155, etc. without written a line of code.
More of which is discussed in the [via thirdweb Explore](#via-thirdweb-explore) section.

Furthermore, for developers looking to develop and develop custom smart contracts can use the [Solidity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/build/overview) provided by thirdweb, among others such as [TypeScript SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5) and [Unity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity).
However, for this guide we will mainly talk about the [thirdweb Explore](https://thirdweb.com/explore) and the [Solidity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/build/overview).

**Features:**

- [Explore](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/explore/overview): Ready to deploy contracts.
- [Build](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/build/overview): Write your own smart contracts.
- [Deploy](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/deploy/overview): Contract deployment built for any use-case.
- [Publish](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/publish/overview): Publish your contracts onchain.
- [Interact](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/interact/overview): Integrate smart contract interactions directly into your app.
