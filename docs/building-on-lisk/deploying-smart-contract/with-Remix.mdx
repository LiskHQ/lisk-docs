# Deploying a smart contract with Remix

On this page, you will learn how to create, deploy and verify a smart contract with the Remix IDE to the **Lisk Sepolia** testnet.

Remix Online IDE is a powerful toolset for developing, deploying, debugging, and testing Ethereum and EVM-compatible smart contracts.
It requires no setup and can be accessed directly through the browser under https://remix.ethereum.org/.

## Prerequisites

### Wallet funds

**Deploying contracts** to the blockchain requires a **gas fee**.
Therefore, you will need to fund your wallet with ETH to cover those gas fees.

For this guide, you will be deploying a contract to the Lisk Sepolia Testnet. 

You can deposit the required tokens by using the [Lisk Bridge](https://sepolia-bridge.lisk.com/bridge/lisk-sepolia-testnet).

In case your wallet doesn't hold enough `SepoliaETH`, use one of the available faucets for the **Ethereum Sepolia** Testnet like [https://sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) to receive free Testnet ETH.
Then, use the aforementioned Lisk Bridge to send tokens from the **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet** to the **Lisk Sepolia Testnet**.

:::note
You can deploy a contract on Lisk Mainnet by adopting the same process.
Before deploying to Mainnet, ensure that your wallet has enough ETH.

## Interacting with the Smart Contract

After [the contract is verified](#7-verify-the-contract), you can use the `Read Contract` and `Write Contract` tabs to interact with the deployed contract via Blockscout: https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com/address/0x73e7a94dD5760d862F6FD9f8ea5D4245Bb143446?tab=contract.
Don't forget to update the contract address in the Blockscout URL.
You'll also need to connect your wallet first, by clicking the `Connect Wallet` button.
