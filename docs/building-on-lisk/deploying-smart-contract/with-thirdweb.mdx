# Deploying a smart contract with thirdweb
[thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) is an end-to-end framework for smart contract development and deployment.

It enables developers to deploy, standard contracts such as ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155, etc. without writing a line of code.
More of this is discussed in the [via thirdweb Explore](#via-thirdweb-explore) section.

Furthermore, developers looking to develop and develop custom smart contracts can use the [Solidity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/build/overview) provided by thirdweb, among others such as [TypeScript SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5) and [Unity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity).
However, for this guide, we will mainly talk about the [thirdweb Explore](https://thirdweb.com/explore) and the [Solidity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/build/overview).

**Features:**

- [Explore](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/explore/overview): Ready to deploy contracts.
- [Build](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/build/overview): Write your smart contracts.
- [Deploy](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/deploy/overview): Contract deployment built for any use case.
- [Publish](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/publish/overview): Publish your contracts onchain.
- [Interact](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/interact/overview): Integrate smart contract interactions directly into your app.

### Installing and Configuring thirdweb

To develop custom contracts, it is required to download and configure thirdweb.
But, first, let's install some pre-requisites.

#### Prerequisites

1. Download and install [Node v18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. To install thirdweb run the following command:
    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>
        ```bash
        npm i -g thirdweb
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn global add thirdweb
        ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
3. [Set up your thirdweb API key](https://youtu.be/jYEqoIeAoBg?t=9467).
4. The next step is to log in to thirdweb via CLI, so to do that type the following:
    ```bash
    thirweb login
    ```
    1. Once, you execute the aforementioned command, the terminal will open a browser window where it will ask you to authenticate the device:
        ```text
        .......

        💎 thirdweb v0.13.60 💎

        Automatically attempting to open a link to authenticate with our dashboard...

        If the browser doesn't open, please use this link to authenticate:

        https://thirdweb.com/cli/login?payload=%7B%22payload%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22evm%22%2C%22domain%22%3A%22thirdweb.com%22%2C%22address%22%3A%220x4fA5f77Fadcc319c626b28Ea6260FB0c3Ba6e41C%22%2C%22statement%22%3A%22Please%20ensure%20that%20the%20domain%20above%20matches%20the%20URL%20of%20the%20cuhdksjahjkdhkshajkdhkshakjhsjhdsajkhhdhs

        ⠙ Waiting for a response from the dashboard
        ```
    2. Once you authenticate via the browser, the terminal will log the following message:
        ```text
        Successfully linked your account to this device 
        ```
    3. You can verify your login status by re-running the `thirdweb login` command.
        ```text
        💎 thirdweb v0.13.60 💎
        You are already logged in
        ```

## Creating a project
The first step of deploying smart contracts to Lisk is to set up your development environment by creating a project.
The thirdweb supports two of the most popular smart contracts development frameworks such as [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org).
For this guide, we are using Foundry for smart contract development.
However, you can use Hardhat if you are more comfortable with that.
The project creation steps are similar for both Foundry and Hardhat.

1. For Foundry, install its [prerequisites](/building-on-lisk/deploying-smart-contract/with-Foundry#prerequisites) on your system before proceeding with the creation of a thirdweb project.
2. Once, the aforementioned is installed, proceed with the following:
    ```bash
    npx thirdweb create
    ```
3. Choose `Contract` as the type of your project and give an appropriate name to your project.
    ```text
    .......

    💎 thirdweb v0.13.60 💎

    ✔ What type of project do you want to create? › Contract
    ✔ What is your project named? … thirdweb-contracts
    ``` 
4. Next, choose `Forge` as the framework, `NFT` as the name of the contract, `ERC721` as the type of smart contract, and `None` for the extensions option.
    ```text
    ✔ What framework do you want to use? › Forge
    ✔ What will be the name of your new smart contract? … NFT
    ✔ What type of contract do you want to start from? › ERC721
    ✔ What extensions do you want to add to your contract? › None
    ```
5. thirdweb will install all the relevant dependencies and set up a contract project for you.

    Initialized a git repository.

    Success! Created thirdweb-contracts at /Users/XYZ/Lightcurve-Code/L2/thirdweb-contracts

    Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    yarn build
        Compiles your contracts and detects thirdweb extensions implemented on them.

    yarn deploy
        Deploys your contracts with the thirdweb deploy flow.

    yarn publish
        Publishes your contracts with the thirdweb publish flow.

    We suggest that you begin by typing:

    cd thirdweb-contracts
    ```
    </details>

6. Foundry applications created with thirdweb have a similar directory structure to the following:

    ```bash
    .
    ├── .github
    ├── .cache
    ├── lib
    ├── node_modules
    ├── out
    ├── src
    │   └── NFT.sol
    ├── test
    │   └── Contract.t.sol
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .gitmodules
    ├── foundry.toml
    └── README.md
    ``` 

### **Creating** the smart contract

For ease and security, thirdweb already provides base contracts, which can be easily customized via code.
Since we chose to create an `ERC721` token earlier, an `NFT.sol` file will be present in the `src/` folder.
The `NFT.sol` will already have the base code required for an NFT contract.

```sol title="src/NFT.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

contract NFT is ERC721Base {
    constructor(
        address _defaultAdmin,
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    )
        ERC721Base(
            _defaultAdmin,
            _name,
            _symbol,
            _royaltyRecipient,
            _royaltyBps
        )
    {}
}

```

### **Building** the smart contract
Once the smart contract's code is ready, it must be built using thirdweb.

1. To do that, simply run:
    ```bash
    npx thirdweb build
    ```
2. If the smart contract doesn't have any errors, you will see the following output on the terminal:
    ```text
    .......

    💎 thirdweb v0.13.62 💎

    ✔ Detected project type: foundry
    ✔ Compilation successful
    ✔ Choose which contracts to run detection on · NFT

    ℹ Once you're done writing your contracts, you can run the following command to deploy them:

     yarn deploy
    ```

### **Deploying** the smart contract
All checks passed, which means that the smart contract is ready to be deployed using thirdweb.

1. To do that, simply run:
    ```bash
    npx thirdweb deploy
    ```
2. If the smart contract doesn't have any errors, you will see the following output on the terminal:
    ```text
    .......

    💎 thirdweb v0.13.60 💎

    ✔ Detected project type: foundry
    ✔ Compilation successful
    ✔ Choose which contract(s) to deploy · NFT
    ✔ Upload successful
    // highlight-next-line
    ✔ Open this link to deploy your contracts: https://thirdweb.com/contracts/deploy/QmSJExQJfPYFuaRZuDu9XRR2jUu9yp3kaFX3Sdc1KRWxiP
    ```

3. The terminal will also open a browser window, directing towards a unique URL, as highlighted above.
4. Fill out the form as suggested in the [Fill Parameter](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/deploy/deploy-contract#Fill%20parameter) section.
5. Once you fill out the details of the ERC721 smart contract, click on the `Deploy Now` button and it will deploy the contract to the chosen network of your wallet.

## Interacting with the Smart Contract

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it as explained in the [Interacting with deployed contracts via Explore](#interacting-with-deployed-contracts-via-explore) section.
