# Web3 App Development

## PWA
A Progressive Web App (= PWA) allows users to install your web app to their device.
They appear as native apps on your desktop or mobile device and offer features like offline support and push notifications.
This way, PWA allow to develop an application that can be used via browser[^1], mobile, or desktop application alike.

Therefore, PWAs are a great choice to reach users on different platforms simultaneously.

Additionally, PWAs allow a user to directly install the app through your web app, without need to visit an app store.
This allows you to serve the app directly to the users, without bothering about high restrictions of app stores on what is allowed for blockchain applications.
In-app purchase fees can also be avoided because users no longer need to go through the app store.

The major app stores support the publication of PWAs to varying to degrees.
Currently, Google Play, Microsoft Store, and Samsung Galaxy Store support PWAs, but Apple App Store does not.

[^1]: Only supported in PWA-compatible browsers (most Chromium based browsers should work).
