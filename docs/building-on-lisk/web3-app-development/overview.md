# Web3 App Development

## Web3 App development steps

### 1. The idea:
Define what you want to create with the Web3 app and what problems your application will resolve.
### 2. Choosing the blockchain ecosystem
### 3. Smart contract development
In this tutorial, we use [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) to develop and deploy our smart contracts.
### 4. App frontend development
Choose the best suitable Web3 framework, such as React or Angular, to build the frontend of your Web3 app.
We recommend to choose a Web3 development kit on top which provides a convenient framework to deveop Web3 applications.

In this tutorial, we use [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) as web3 development platform.

#### Choosing the right app platform(s)

##### Mobile friendly apps
The first decision youâ€™ll need to make when developing a mobile-friendly Web3 application is whether you want to design a native application, a [progressive web application](#pwa), or a mobile website.

Each of these options comes with its own set of challenges. 


## PWA
A Progressive Web App (= PWA) allows users to install your web app to their device.
They appear as native apps on your desktop or mobile device and offer features like offline support and push notifications.
This way, PWA allow to develop an application that can be used via browser[^1], mobile, or desktop application alike.

Therefore, PWAs are a great choice to reach users on different platforms simultaneously.

Additionally, PWAs allow a user to directly install the app through your web app, without need to visit an app store.
This allows you to serve the app directly to the users, without bothering about high restrictions of app stores on what is allowed for blockchain applications.
In-app purchase fees can also be avoided because users no longer need to go through the app store.

The major app stores support the publication of PWAs to varying to degrees.
Currently, Google Play, Microsoft Store, and Samsung Galaxy Store support PWAs, but Apple App Store does not.

[^1]: Only supported in PWA-compatible browsers (most Chromium based browsers should work).
