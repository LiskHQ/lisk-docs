# Web3 App Development

On this page, you will learn what Web3 applications are, 

## What are Web3 applications?

### Evolution of the Web
Since the internet was born, there has been constant innovation in how people use the internet to communicate and interact with each other.
To describe important steps in this innovation, websites and apps are generally categorized into different Web "versions":

<Tabs queryString="web-version">
  <TabItem value="web1" label="Web 1.0">
    Web 1.0 is the first "version" of the Web, i.e. the first generation of websites that occured when the internet became available to the broader public around 1990.
    Web 1.0 is often referred to as the "static" or "read-only" web, consisting mainly of simple static HTML pages with limited interactivity.

    However, some Web 2.0 capabilities were present in the days of Web 1.0, but were implemented differently.
    For example, a Web 1.0 site may have had a guestbook page for visitor comments, instead of a comment section at the end of each page (typical of Web 2.0). 

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="web2" label="Web 2.0">
    In the late 1990s the transition to [Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) started, when some Web 1.0 sites introduced dynamic HTML with social features, allowing users to interact with web pages in a much more fluent way. 

    :::info
    The term "Web 2.0" was coined by Darcy DiNucci, an information architecture consultant, in her January 1999 article [Fragmented Future](http://darcyd.com/fragmented_future.pdf).
    :::

    Web 2.0 is the era where social media, [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application), and mobile apps come to the rise.
    
    <h5>Web2 limitations</h5>

    Though Web 2.0 revolutionized how people use the web in a positive way, it's characteristics lead to certain disadvantages, for users who interact with Web2 applications:

    - Censorship
    - Lack of transparency
    - Limited privacy  
    - Limited interoperability
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="web3" label="Web 3.0" default>
    Web 3.0 is the next step in the evolution of the Web, aiming to address the [limitations of Web 2.0](overview.mdx?web-version=web2#web2-limitations).

</Tabs>

## Web3 App platforms

{/* <!-- ### 1. The idea:
Define what you want to create with the Web3 app and what problems your application will resolve.
### 2. Choosing the blockchain ecosystem
### 3. Smart contract development
In this tutorial, we use [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) to develop and deploy our smart contracts.
### 4. App frontend development
Choose the best suitable Web3 framework, such as React or Angular, to build the frontend of your Web3 app.
We recommend to choose a Web3 development kit on top which provides a convenient framework to deveop Web3 applications.

In this tutorial, we use [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) as web3 development platform.

#### Choosing the right app platform(s) --> */}

## Mobile
The first decision you'll need to make when developing a mobile-friendly Web3 application is whether you want to design a native application, a [progressive web application](#pwa), or a mobile website.

Each of these options comes with its own set of challenges.

## PWA
A Progressive Web App (= PWA) allows users to install your web app to their device.
They appear as native apps on your desktop or mobile device and offer features like offline support and push notifications.
This way, PWA allow to develop an application that can be used via browser[^1], mobile, or desktop application alike.

Therefore, PWAs are a great choice to reach users on different platforms simultaneously.

Additionally, PWAs allow a user to directly install the app through your web app, without need to visit an app store.
This allows you to serve the app directly to the users, without bothering about high restrictions of app stores on what is allowed for blockchain applications.
In-app purchase fees can also be avoided because users no longer need to go through the app store.

The major app stores support the publication of PWAs to varying to degrees.
Currently, Google Play, Microsoft Store, and Samsung Galaxy Store support PWAs, but Apple App Store does not.

[^1]: Only supported in PWA-compatible browsers (most Chromium based browsers should work).
