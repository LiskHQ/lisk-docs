# Deploying your Custom ERC-20 token to Lisk

{/* :::info
**This tutorial is for developers who want to bridge a new Custom ERC-20 token to Lisk Mainnet.**
 If you want to bridge existing tokens, you can follow the tutorial on [Bridging ERC-20 tokens with the Optimism SDK](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/app-developers/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20).
::: */}

In this tutorial you'll learn how to bridge a custom ERC-20 token from Ethereum to Lisk Sepolia using the [Standard Bridge system](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/dapp-developers/bridging/standard-bridge).
This tutorial is meant for developers who already have an existing ERC-20 token on Ethereum and want to create a bridged representation of that token on Lisk Sepolia.

Learn step-by-step how you can create a custom token that conforms to the [`IOptimismMintableERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/v1.1.4/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/IOptimismMintableERC20.sol) interface so that it can be used with the Standard Bridge system.
A custom token allows you to do things like trigger extra logic whenever a token is deposited.
If you don't need extra functionality like this, consider following the tutorial on [Deploying your Standard ERC-20 token to Lisk](./standard-token) instead.

## Prerequisites

### Get ETH on Sepolia and Lisk Sepolia

You will need to get some ETH on both, Sepolia and Lisk Sepolia networks.

:::info
You can use [ETH Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) to get ETH on Sepolia.
You can use the [Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=docs) to get ETH on Lisk Sepolia.
:::

### Add Lisk Sepolia to Your Wallet

This tutorial uses [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) to deploy contracts.
You will need to add the Lisk Sepolia network to your wallet in order to follow this tutorial.
Please follow the [How to connect Lisk to a wallet](../connecting-to-a-wallet.mdx) guide, to connect your wallet to Lisk Sepolia.

### Get an L1 ERC-20 Token Address

You will need an L1 ERC-20 token for this tutorial.
If you already have an L1 ERC-20 token deployed on Sepolia, you can skip this step.
Otherwise, you can use the testing token located at [`0x5589BB8228C07c4e15558875fAf2B859f678d129`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x5589BB8228C07c4e15558875fAf2B859f678d129) that includes a `faucet()` function that can be used to mint tokens.

## Create an L2 ERC-20 Token

Once you have an L1 ERC-20 token, you can create a corresponding L2 ERC-20 token on Lisk Sepolia.
This tutorial uses [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org), so you can easily deploy a token without a framework like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) or [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh).
You can follow the same general process within your favorite framework if you prefer.

In this section, you'll be creating an ERC-20 token that can be deposited but cannot be withdrawn.
This is just one example of the endless ways in which you could customize your L2 token.

### 1. Open Remix

Navigate to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) in your browser.

### 2. Create a new file

Click the ðŸ“„ ("Create new file") button to create a new empty Solidity file.
You can name this file whatever you'd like, e.g. `custom-token.sol`.

### 3. Copy the example contract

Copy the following example contract into your new file:

<details>
<summary>custom-token.sol</summary>
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import { ERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import { IERC165 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol";
import { IOptimismMintableERC20 } from "https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/v1.1.4/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/IOptimismMintableERC20.sol";

contract MyCustomL2Token is IOptimismMintableERC20, ERC20 {
    /// @notice Address of the corresponding version of this token on the remote chain.
    address public immutable REMOTE_TOKEN;

    /// @notice Address of the StandardBridge on this network.
    address public immutable BRIDGE;

    /// @notice Emitted whenever tokens are minted for an account.
    /// @param account Address of the account tokens are being minted for.
    /// @param amount  Amount of tokens minted.
    event Mint(address indexed account, uint256 amount);

    /// @notice Emitted whenever tokens are burned from an account.
    /// @param account Address of the account tokens are being burned from.
    /// @param amount  Amount of tokens burned.
    event Burn(address indexed account, uint256 amount);

    /// @notice A modifier that only allows the bridge to call.
    modifier onlyBridge() {
        require(msg.sender == BRIDGE, "MyCustomL2Token: only bridge can mint and burn");
        _;
    }

    /// @param _bridge      Address of the L2 standard bridge.
    /// @param _remoteToken Address of the corresponding L1 token.
    /// @param _name        ERC20 name.
    /// @param _symbol      ERC20 symbol.
    constructor(
        address _bridge,
        address _remoteToken,
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol
    )
        ERC20(_name, _symbol)
    {
        REMOTE_TOKEN = _remoteToken;
        BRIDGE = _bridge;
    }

    /// @custom:legacy
    /// @notice Legacy getter for REMOTE_TOKEN.
    function remoteToken() public view returns (address) {
        return REMOTE_TOKEN;
    }

    /// @custom:legacy
    /// @notice Legacy getter for BRIDGE.
    function bridge() public view returns (address) {
        return BRIDGE;
    }

    /// @notice ERC165 interface check function.
    /// @param _interfaceId Interface ID to check.
    /// @return Whether or not the interface is supported by this contract.
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 _interfaceId) external pure virtual returns (bool) {
        bytes4 iface1 = type(IERC165).interfaceId;
        // Interface corresponding to the updated OptimismMintableERC20 (this contract).
        bytes4 iface2 = type(IOptimismMintableERC20).interfaceId;
        return _interfaceId == iface1 || _interfaceId == iface2;
    }

    /// @notice Allows the StandardBridge on this network to mint tokens.
    /// @param _to     Address to mint tokens to.
    /// @param _amount Amount of tokens to mint.
    function mint(
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount
    )
        external
        virtual
        override(IOptimismMintableERC20)
        onlyBridge
    {
        _mint(_to, _amount);
        emit Mint(_to, _amount);
    }

    /// @notice Prevents tokens from being withdrawn to L1.
    function burn(
        address,
        uint256
    )
        external
        virtual
        override(IOptimismMintableERC20)
        onlyBridge
    {
        revert("MyCustomL2Token cannot be withdrawn");
    }
}
```
</details>

### 4. Review the example contract

Take a moment to review the example contract.
It's almost the same as the standard [`OptimismMintableERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/v1.1.4/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/OptimismMintableERC20.sol) contract except that the `_burn` function has been made to always revert.

The contract for the custom token inherits from the [`IOptimismMintableERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/v1.1.4/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/IOptimismMintableERC20.sol) interface and the `ERC20` contract.
The constructor takes the address of the L2 standard bridge, the address of the corresponding L1 token, the name of the ERC20 token, and the symbol of the ERC20 token.
The `mint` function allows the bridge to mint tokens for users.
Since the bridge needs to burn tokens when users want to withdraw them to L1, this means that users will not be able to withdraw tokens from this contract, which is what we intend for this example.

```solidity
/// @notice Prevents tokens from being withdrawn to L1.
function burn(
    address,
    uint256
)
    external
    virtual
    override(IOptimismMintableERC20)
    onlyBridge
{
    revert("MyCustomL2Token cannot be withdrawn");
}
```

### 5. Compile the contract

Save the file to automatically compile the contract.
If you've disabled auto-compile, you'll need to manually compile the contract by clicking the "Solidity Compiler" tab (this looks like the letter "S") and pressing the blue "Compile" button.

### 6. Deploy the contract

Open the deployment tab (this looks like an Ethereum logo with an arrow pointing right).
Make sure that your environment is set to "Injected Provider", your wallet is connected to Lisk Sepolia, and Remix has access to your wallet.
Then, select the `MyCustomL2Token` contract from the deployment dropdown and deploy it with the following parameters:

```text
_BRIDGE:      "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000007"
_REMOTETOKEN: "<L1 ERC-20 address>"
_NAME:        "My Custom Lisk L2 Token"
_SYMBOL:      "MCL2T"
```

:::tip
If you used the testing token described in step [Get an L1 ERC-20 Token Address](#get-an-l1-erc-20-token-address), use the address `0x5589BB8228C07c4e15558875fAf2B859f678d129` for the `_REMOTETOKEN` parameter.

{/* ## Bridge Some Tokens

Now that you have an L2 ERC-20 token, you can bridge some tokens from L1 to L2.
 Check out the tutorial on [Bridging ERC-20 tokens with the Optimism SDK](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/app-developers/tutorials/cross-dom-bridge-erc20) to learn how to bridge your L1 ERC-20 to Lisk using the Optimism SDK.
Remember that the withdrawal step will *not* work for the token you just created!
This is exactly what this tutorial was meant to demonstrate. */}
