# Bridging an L1 token to Lisk
This page is intended for token issuers who already have an ERC-20 contract deployed on Ethereum and would like to submit their token for bridging between Ethereum and Lisk. 
Lisk uses the Superchain Token List as a reference for tokens that have been deployed on Lisk.

## Superchain Token List
The [Superchain Token List](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io) exists to help users discover the right bridged token addresses for any given native token.
Consider checking this list to make sure that you're not using the wrong bridged representation of a token when bridging a native token.

Developers who are creating their own bridged tokens should consider [adding their token to the list](#adding-your-token-to-the-list).

:::tip
Tokens on the Superchain Token List will automatically appear on certain tools like the [Superchain Bridges UI](https://app.optimism.io/bridge).

However, tokens are not necessarily listed on the [Lisk Bridge UI](https://bridge.lisk.com/bridge/lisk); their listing is neither guaranteed nor automatic.
Lisk Bridge reviews are conducted manually by the Lisk team.
:::

## The Standard bridge
The Standard Bridge allows users to convert tokens that are native to one chain (like Ethereum) into a representation of those tokens on the other chain (like Lisk).
Users can then convert these bridged representations back into their original native tokens at any time.

This bridging mechanism functions identically in both directions â€” tokens native to Lisk can be bridged to Ethereum, just like tokens native to Ethereum can be bridged to Lisk.
The [Standard Token Bridge](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/app-developers/bridging/standard-bridge) is a simple smart contract with the functionality to move ERC-20 tokens between Lisk and Ethereum.
It also allows users to easily create L2 representations of existing tokens on Ethereum.

The protocol consists of two pertinent contracts:

- A bridge contract deployed to Ethereum, called [L1StandardBridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2658723Bf70c7667De6B25F99fcce13A16D25d08). 
- A bridge contract deployed to Lisk, called [L2StandardBridge](https://blockscout.lisk.com/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010).

These two contracts interact with one another via the `CrossDomainMessenger` system for sending messages between Ethereum and Lisk.

## Adding your token to the list

Lisk uses [Optimism's Superchain token list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/blob/master/optimism.tokenlist.json) as a reference for tokens that have been deployed on Lisk.

:::warning

Tokens approved in the GitHub repository are not necessarily listed on the [Lisk Bridge](https://sepolia-bridge.lisk.com).

**Disclaimer:** Lisk does not endorse any of the tokens that are listed in the [**ethereum-optimism.github.io**](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io) repository and rely on the preliminary checks put in place, which include the [**automated checks**](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io?tab=readme-ov-file#automated-checks) listed on the repository.

To add your token to the Lisk Token list, perform the following steps.

### Step 1: Deploy your token on Lisk
Select your preferred bridging framework and use it to deploy an ERC-20 for your token on Lisk.
We recommend you use the framework provided by Lisk's [standard bridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/protocol/bridges.md) contracts, and furthermore deploy your token using the [OptimismMintableERC20Factory](https://docs.lisk.com/contracts#lisk-l2)[^1]. 
Deploying your token on Lisk in this manner provides us with guarantees that will smooth the approval process.
If you choose a different bridging framework, its interface must be compatible with that of the standard bridge, otherwise it may be difficult for us to support.

[^1]: 
The `IOptimismMintableERC20` interface is a superset of the standard ERC-20 interface and includes functions that allow the bridge to properly verify deposits/withdrawals and mint/burn tokens as needed.
Your L2 token contract must implement this interface in order to be bridged using the Standard Bridge system.

For step by step instructions how to deploy ERC-20 tokens on Lisk, check the following guides:

- [Deploying a Standard ERC-20 token](./standard-token.md)
- [Deploying a Custom ERC-20 token](./custom-token.mdx)

### Step 2: Submit details of your token
Follow the instructions in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io) and submit a PR containing the required details for your token.

You must specify in your token's `data.json` file a section for `lisk-sepolia` and/or `lisk`.

[This PR](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/899) shows the changes necessary to add the LSK token to the Superchain Token Registry.
The change you need to submit is particularly simple if your token has already been added to the Superchain Token Registry.
For example, [this PR](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/commit/27ab9b2d3388f7feba3a152e0a0748c73d732a68) shows the change required for cbETH, which was already on Superchain Token Registry and relies on the Base standard bridge.

### Step 3: Await final approval
Reviews are regularly conducted by the Lisk team and you should receive a reply within 24-72 hours (depending on if the PR is opened on a weekday, weekend or holiday).
