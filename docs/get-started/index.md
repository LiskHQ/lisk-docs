# Lisk Documentation

## The Lisk Chain

Lisk provides a cost-efficient, fast, and scalable Layer 2 (L2) network based on Optimism (OP) that is secured by Ethereum. Built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack and partnered with Gelato as a RaaS provider, Lisk contributes to scaling Ethereum to a level where blockchain infrastructure is ready for mass adoption.

### Why Lisk?

- **Ultra-Fast, Near-Zero Fees**:
Built on a high-throughput network, Lisk Chain features a 2-second block time and median network fees that are consistently under $0.01 to ensure performance meets affordability.
- **Built for high-growth markets**:
Lisk provides real-world use with local stablecoins, fiat on-ramps, and integrations that unlock mainstream adoption of Web3 applications.
- **EVM Equivalence**:
Deploy your Solidity and Vyper contracts instantly. Lisk’s EVM compatibility means you can leverage existing code, favorite tools like Hardhat and Foundry, and the vast ecosystem of audited smart contracts to cut development time dramatically.
- **Built on the OP-Stack**:
Lisk leverages the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/concepts/stack/getting-started), the industry-leading open-source standard. This foundation ensures your app is future-proof, highly secure, and seamlessly integrated into a continuously innovating blockchain ecosystem.
- **Native Superchain Access**:
With [Superchain](https://docs.optimism.io/app-developers/guides/superchain) Interoperability going live, your application gains native, seamless access to a massive shared ecosystem. This includes users and liquidity from major chains like Optimism, Base, Unichain, and many more.
- **Decentralized governance**:
LSK token holders can contribute to the governance of the Lisk project via **the Lisk DAO** by delegating or voting directly on proposals that decide how funds are distributed in the ecosystem, in order to create the most impact.
