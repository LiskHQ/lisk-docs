# Importing LSK to MetaMask
By default, MetaMask doesn't show owned LSK tokens in a wallet account. 
This means that a holder of LSK has to import the LSK tokens manually to the wallet for different networks, in order to have them displayed in the MetaMask wallet.
:::note
Make sure your wallet has been connected to the relevant network, which can be either
- **Lisk Mainnet**
- **Lisk Sepolia Testnet**, or
- **Ethereum**

For more information, see the relevant information in the [How to Connect Lisk to a Wallet](connecting-to-a-wallet) guide.
