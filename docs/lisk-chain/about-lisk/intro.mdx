# Introduction to Lisk
{/* <span className="overview-span">
    <h2>Getting started</h2>

</span> */}


Lisk provides a cost-efficient, fast, and scalable Layer 2 (L2) network based on [Optimism](https://docs.optimism.io/) (OP) that is secured by Ethereum.
Built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started) and partnered with [Gelato](https://www.gelato.network/) as a RaaS provider, Lisk contributes to scaling Ethereum to a level where blockchain infrastructure is ready for mass adoption.

With [Optimism's Superchain](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/explainer) initiative, Lisk is participating in building the future it always believed in, which is to develop an interoperable, seamless base layer that provides a great user experience, shared liquidity, and cheap transactions to ensure that **web3** revolutionizes peoples' lives just as **web2** did.
Lisk is part of Optimism's Superchain initiative, and it will be scaled and built by the experienced Lisk team in collaboration with Optimism.
By being part of the Superchain, Lisk offers a network of chains that share bridging, decentralized governance, regular upgrades, a communication layer, and more—all built on the OP Stack while being secured by Ethereum.

We operate a highly reliable [EVM-equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306) blockchain compatible with the most widely used tooling in the blockchain space thereby creating a great platform for developers.
For more information, check the Lisk Tools section on the left.

## Getting started guides

- [Connecting Lisk to a wallet](/guides/connecting-to-a-wallet)
- [How to import LSK to a wallet](/guides/import-lsk)
- [Deploying a smart contract](/category/deploying-a-smart-contract)
- [Interacting with the blockchain](/category/interacting-with-the-blockchain)

## Features

- **Ultra-Fast, Near-Zero Fees**:
Built on a high-throughput network, Lisk Chain features a 2-second block time and median network fees that are consistently under $0.01 to ensure performance meets affordability.
- **Built for high-growth markets**:
Lisk provides real-world use with local stablecoins, fiat on-ramps, and integrations that unlock mainstream adoption of Web3 applications.
- **EVM Equivalence**:
Deploy your Solidity and Vyper contracts instantly. Lisk’s EVM compatibility means you can leverage existing code, favorite tools like Hardhat and Foundry, and the vast ecosystem of audited smart contracts to cut development time dramatically.
- **Built on the OP-Stack**:
Lisk leverages the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/concepts/stack/getting-started), the industry-leading open-source standard. This foundation ensures your app is future-proof, highly secure, and seamlessly integrated into a continuously innovating blockchain ecosystem.
- **Decentralized governance**:
LSK token holders can contribute to the governance of the Lisk project via **the Lisk DAO** by delegating their voting power or voting directly on proposals that decide how funds are distributed in the ecosystem, in order to create the most impact.

## How secure is Lisk?
Lisk's Mainnet keeps it in sync with the Ethereum L1 after regular intervals to ensure the security and validity of its network.
For more information, see [Optimism's rollup protocol](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/overview) and its [Fault Proof](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/overview#fault-proofs) section.
This means that apart from the measures taken to secure the Superchain and Lisk's Mainnet, the L1 security of Ethereum is also available to users interacting with Lisk L2.

For more information, check out the [Lisk Governance overview](https://lisk.com/token/).

## Connection to Ethereum

Any L2 based on OP Stack is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 (Lisk Mainnet, Lisk Sepolia, etc.) and the underlying L1 (Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia, etc.). This makes it possible to transfer ETH or tokens such as ERC20, ERC721 tokens, etc. between the two networks.
For more information on the tokens available on Lisk see [Optimism Tokens](https://cryptorank.io/blockchains/optimism).

:::info
Lisk is an OP stack chain and is designed to be [EVM equivalent](https://web.archive.org/web/20231127160757/https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306).
However, there are a few differences between [Ethereum and OP stack chains](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences), which developers should be aware of.
