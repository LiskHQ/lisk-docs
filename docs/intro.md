# Introduction to Lisk

Lisk provides a cost-efficient, fast, and scalable Layer 2 (L2) network that is secured by Ethereum.
Lisk is based on [Optimism's L2 rollup](https://docs.optimism.io/), and it is already contributing to [Optimism's Super chain's philosophy](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/explainer).

With Optimism's Super chain initiative, Lisk is participating in building the future it always believed in, which is an interoperable, seamless base layer that provides a great user experience, shared liquidity, and cheap transactions to ensure that web3 revolutionizes peoples' lives just as web2 did.

### Why Lisk L2? and Who is it for?

With [Gelato](https://www.gelato.network/) as a professional Rollup-as-a-Service provider and the battle-tested [OP stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started), we operate a highly reliable [EVM-equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306) blockchain compatible with the most widely used tooling in the blockchain space thereby creating a great platform for developers.
By being part of the Superchain: Lisk offers a network of chains that share bridging, decentralized governance, regular upgrades, a communication layer, and moreâ€”all built on the OP Stack, and secured by Ethereum.

## How secure is Lisk L2?

Lisk L2 is based on the concept of [Optimistic rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups), hence, transactions made to Lisk L2 will be treated as valid for a specific period of time (also known as the challenge window), before they become part of Optimism's mainnet.

Once the transactions go unchallenged for the set challenge window, the transactions are considered final and then the smart contract on Ethereum L1 can safely accept such transactions.
On the contrary, when transactions are challenged successfully, they are replaced with correct transactions and are then made part of Optimism's mainnet and subsequently to Ethereum.

Optimism's mainnet continuously keeps it in sync with the Ethereum L1 to ensure the security and validity of its network.
For more information, see [Optimism's roll-up protocol](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/overview) and the [How it ensures Fault Proof?](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/overview#fault-proofs)

## Connection to Ethereum

Any L2 based on Optimism is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 (OP Mainnet, OP Sepolia, etc.) and the underlying L1 (Ethereum mainnet, Sepolia, etc.). This makes it possible to transfer ETH or tokens, including ERC20 tokens, between the two networks.

Lisk is an Optimism stack chain and it is designed to be EVM equivalent, however, there are a few differences between [Ethereum and Optimism stack chains](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences), which developers should be aware of.

## Contributors
As a long-standing Web3 infrastructure project, Lisk has been democratizing blockchain accessibility for developers and end users globally since 2016.
Lisk L2 is built on the MIT-Licensed OP Stack, in collaboration with Optimism.
Lisk is among the initial members joining Optimism's Superchain initiative, and the Lisk L2 will be scaled and built by the experienced Lisk and Optimism teams.
