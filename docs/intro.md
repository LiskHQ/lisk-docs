# Introduction to Lisk

Lisk provides a cost-efficient, fast, and scalable Layer 2 (L2) network that is secured by Ethereum.
Built on the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/), Lisk contributes to scaling Ethereum to a level where blockchain infrastructure is ready for mass adoption.

With Optimism's Super chain initiative, Lisk is participating in building the future it always believed in, which is an interoperable, seamless base layer that provides a great user experience, shared liquidity, and cheap transactions to ensure that web3 revolutionizes peoples' lives just as web2 did.

With [Gelato](https://www.gelato.network/) as a professional Rollup-as-a-Service provider and the battle-tested [OP stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started), we operate a highly reliable [EVM-equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306) blockchain compatible with the most widely used tooling in the blockchain space thereby creating a great platform for developers.
By being part of the Superchain: Lisk offers a network of chains that share bridging, decentralized governance, regular upgrades, a communication layer, and moreâ€”all built on the OP Stack, and secured by Ethereum.

## How secure is Lisk L2?

Lisk L2 is part of the [Optimism collective](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/) and Optimism is seeking to establish a [Security Council](https://optimism.help/Token+House+Governance/Security+Council/Intro+to+Optimism's+Security+Council), for distributed governance, and equal participation of all OP stack chains to the super chain.
Such measures will ensure that decisions like using distributed sequencers, proposers, challengers, etc. can be made unanimously with the agreement of all the members of the Super chain and the Security Council.

Furthermore, Optimism's mainnet continuously keeps it in sync with the Ethereum L1 to ensure the security and validity of its network.
This means that apart from the measures taken to secure the Superchain and Optimism's mainnet, the L1 security of Ethereum is also available to users interacting with Lisk L2.
For more information, see [Optimism's roll-up protocol](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/overview) and the [How it ensures Fault Proof?](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/overview#fault-proofs) section.

## Connection to Ethereum

Any L2 based on Optimism is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 (Lisk Mainnet, Lisk Sepolia, etc.) and the underlying L1 (Ethereum mainnet, Sepolia, etc.). This makes it possible to transfer ETH or tokens such as ERC20, ERC721 tokens, etc. between the two networks.
For more information on the tokens available on Optimism see, [Optimism Tokens](https://cryptorank.io/blockchains/optimism).

Lisk is an Optimism stack chain and it is designed to be [EVM equivalent](https://web.archive.org/web/20231127160757/https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), however, there are a few differences between [Ethereum and Optimism stack chains](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences), which developers should be aware of.

## Contributors
As a long-standing Web3 infrastructure project, Lisk has been democratizing blockchain accessibility for developers and end users globally since 2016.
Lisk L2 is built on the MIT-Licensed OP Stack, in collaboration with Optimism.
Lisk is among the initial members joining Optimism's Superchain initiative, and the Lisk L2 will be scaled and built by the experienced Lisk and Optimism teams.
