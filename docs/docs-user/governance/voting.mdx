# Voting

## Voting on Tally

Follow the steps described below to vote on a proposal of the Lisk DAO.
The Lisk DAO uses [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/lisk) to facilitate the voting on proposals. 

The process in a nutshell:
1. Go to [Lisk DAO](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/lisk) and connect your wallet to Tally. 
2. Navigate to the [Lisk DAO proposals](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/lisk/proposals) page.

3. Select the active proposal you would like to vote on.
4. Click on the `Vote` button in the upper right corner of the page.

5. In the Voting pop up, choose your vote â€” For, Against, or Abstain.
If you'd like, add a comment to explain the reason for your vote to the rest of your DAO.
Once you're done, click `Submit`.

6. Confirm and sign the transaction via your connected wallet.


## Voting without Tally

It is crucial that members of the Lisk DAO can interact with the DAO at any point in time, even when Tally, the standard front end for the Lisk DAO, is down.
Most importantly, voting and delegating should always be possible by interacting directly with the smart contract.
How to vote manually is described below.
For a guide how to delegate your voting power manually, see the [Delegation](delegation) page.

### Prerequisites

You must know the proposal ID of the proposal you want to vote for.
The proposal ID is a very long integer (uint256).

### Steps
1. Go to the `Write proxy` tab on the L2Governor proxy contract on Blockscout: https://blockscout.lisk.com/address/0x58a61b1807a7bDA541855DaAEAEe89b1DDA48568?tab=write_proxy.
2. If your wallet is not already connected to Blockscout, click on `Connect wallet` and follow the instructions to connect your wallet[^1].

3. Click on `3. castVote` to unfold the form for the castVote function.

4. Insert the proposal ID of the proposal you want to vote on into the field `proposalId (uint256)*`.
5. Fill the `support (uint8)*` field as follows:
  - If you want to vote **against** the proposal, insert `0`.
  - If you want to vote **for** the proposal, insert `1`.
  - If you want to vote with **abstain**, insert `2`.
6. Click on the `Write` button.

7. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

To verify the vote was submitted correctly, you can check the `VoteCast` event of your transaction.
