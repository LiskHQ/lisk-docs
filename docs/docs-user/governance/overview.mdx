# Governance overview

At the moment, the security of the Lisk Mainnet is dependent on a [multisig wallet](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/) managed by several key members involved in the Lisk project.
This multisig wallet can be used to upgrade core Lisk Mainnet smart contracts without upgrade delays.

To decentralize the governance of the Lisk project further, Lisk introduces a decentralized autonomous organization, the Lisk DAO, which allows Lisk token holders to participate together in the governance of the Lisk project.

:::info
Every LSK token holder who participates in the DAO is rewarded with [staking rewards](../user/staking/overview#staking-rewards), to incentivize participation in the Lisk governance.
:::

## Lisk DAO
The Lisk DAO provides the opportunity for LSK token holders to participate in the overall governance of the Lisk project, including allocation of funds, protocol updates, or strategic directions.
Decisions are made via [proposals](#proposals).

### Tools
The following are the main tools to participate in the Lisk DAO:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="tally" label="Tally">
  Tally is the platform used to create and vote for proposals of the Lisk DAO.

  The [Lisk DAO Tally instance](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/lisk) is the place where users can vote on proposals or delegate their voting power.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="forum" label="Forum">
  The [Lisk Governance Forum](https://forum.lisk.com/) is the place for the community to discuss the Lisk governance and draft proposals, before they are submitted on Tally.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="discord" label="Discord">
  The `#lisk-dao` channel in the [Lisk Chat](https://lisk.chat) Discord server is a community chat dedicated to discuss topics all around the Lisk DAO, share news and updates, or share ideas for new proposals.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Treasury
The Lisk DAO has an associated treasury, which resides in the [Timelock contract](https://blockscout.lisk.com/address/0x2294A7f24187B84995A2A28112f82f07BE1BceAD?tab=contract).
The current balance of the treasury can be checked on the [Lisk BlockScout Explorer](https://blockscout.lisk.com/address/0x2294A7f24187B84995A2A28112f82f07BE1BceAD?tab=tokens).

The treasury is NOT managed by the Onchain Foundation.
Instead, the funds from the treasury can only be transferred via successful [funding proposals](#proposal-types).

Tokens for the Lisk DAO fund are minted.
They are added to the treasury according to the following vesting plan:

| Year | Amount (LSK) | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 2024 | 15,000,000 | 6,250,000 LSK liquid at migration, 8,750,000 LSK are linearly released in 2024, starting from the migration. |
| 2025 | 15,000,000 | LSK are linearly released over the year. |
| 2026 | 15,000,000 | LSK are linearly released over the year. |

:::note
The DAO fund may be increased further in the future by an additional 100,000,000 LSK over the following 7 years (2027-2033) if the DAO members approve the corresponding proposals.
:::

### Voting power
Every account holding **LSK** is able to **stake/lock** a specific amount of LSK tokens to get some voting power and [staking rewards](../user/staking/overview#staking-rewards).

This works as follows:

- Stake tokens for a specific locking duration (between 2 weeks and 2 years) on the [Lisk Portal](https://portal.lisk.com).
- Receive voting power and staking rewards proportional to the amount of locked tokens.
- [Delegate](#delegation) the voting power on Tally to yourself or another delegate in order to use it.
- After the locking duration ends, the users can unlock their staked tokens.


#### Voting power calculation
Locked tokens provide a voting power proportional to the amount of locked tokens.
Concretely, 1 locked LSK provides one unit of voting power (= 1 vpLSK).

##### Boosting the voting power
Users have the option to pause the countdown of the locking period.
This means that the counting towards the end of the locking period is paused until the user decides to resume it.
In the case of pausing, the user receives a boost of the voting power.
It is set to `lockedAmount * (1 + remainingLockingDurationInDays/365)`.
Hence, the voting power can be increased by up to 200%, which is achieved at the maximum locking duration of 2 years

:::info
The voting power for each proposal is counted from a snapshot on the [creation of the proposal](proposal-lifecycle#2-proposal-creation).
Therefore, pausing the locking duration after a proposal is created does not increase the voting power for this proposal, but for the future ones.
:::

### Delegation
The Governor framework requires **delegating the voting power** in order to use it.
The voting power can be delegated to other users or to yourself.
Self-delegation is a requirement if you want to vote on your own.

Delegation happens on [Tally](#tools).

:::info
Please go to the [Delegation](delegation) page to find out more about the delegation process, including guides how to delegate and how to become a delegate.
:::

### Proposals
Proposals are created on [Tally](#tools).
For spam protection, the following requirement must be fulfilled in order to create a proposal:

- **Proposal threshold**: For creating a proposal, the voting power of the proposer must be at least 300,000 vpLSK, i.e., the value corresponding to 100,000 LSK locked for 2 years where the countdown is paused.

#### Proposal types

| Type        | Description   | Binding?      |
| :---------- |:------------- |:------------- |
| **Funding** | A proposal for receiving a certain amount of funds to an address. If approved, the recipient receives the amount given in the proposal. | Yes|
| **General** |  General proposals about protocol parameters or the project direction in general that may be followed by the Onchain Foundation or not, depending also on feasibility and cost.  | No  |

#### Proposal evaluation
The following requirements must be fulfilled for a proposal to approve:

- **Quorum**: For a proposal to pass, the “yes” and “abstain” votes must sum up at least to 24,000,000 vpLSK, i.e., the value that corresponds to 8,000,000 LSK locked for 2 years where the countdown is paused.
- There must be strictly more “yes” than “no” votes.

#### Implementation of funding proposals
The transfer from the [Lisk DAO treasury](#treasury) can be executed by anyone, once a funding proposal is approved.
Funding proposals are **binding**, which means that no one, not even the Onchain Foundation, can prevent the transfer if the proposal passes.
#### Implementation of general proposals
For approved general proposals, the Onchain Foundation will determine whether the proposal is safe, secure, consistent with the scope of Lisk governance, and capable of being implemented in a legally compliant manner.
If it is, the Foundation will act diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner to cause the proposal to be implemented.

### Administrative role of the Onchain Foundation
The foundation will have an administrative role and will take care of the following:

1. Removal of draft proposals that reasonably appear to be fraudulent, spam-oriented, defamatory, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate.
2. Management of mutually contradictory proposals that are submitted simultaneously or in close proximity to one another.
3. Administration of network maintenance, such as emergency bug fixes or release rollbacks (with or without a governance vote).
