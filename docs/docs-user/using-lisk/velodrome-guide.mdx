# The Velodrome DEX
[Velodrome Finance](https://velodrome.finance/) is a next-generation AMM that combines the best of Curve, Convex and Uniswap, designed to serve as the liquidity hub for the Superchain. 
Velodrome serves as a primary liquidity hub for the Optimism Superchain, which includes chains like OP Mainnet, Base and Lisk.

Velodromes key features:

- **Cross-chain swaps**: The platform enables direct cross-chain swaps across the Superchain using its "SuperSwaps" feature, which simplifies transactions without needing to use bridges or wrapped tokens.
- **Onchain Governance**: Liquidity Providers can decide through voting which Pools receive the most VELO emissions.
- **Decentralized**: 100% of fees and incentives go to users, $0 VC funding

1. The protocol is designed to enable [token swaps](#swapping-tokens) and generate fees from Traders by attracting liquidity.
2. Every epoch [liquidity providers (LPs)](#providing-liquidity) receive $VELO token emissions proportionally to the votes the pools accumulate. Only staked liquidity receive emissions.
3. Participants can lock their $VELO to be able to [vote](#voting-for-pools) on the next epoch distribution of emissions, becoming veVELO Voters.
4. veVELO Voters are rewarded (proportionally to locked amounts) for their votes with 100% of the protocol trading fees from the previous epoch and any additional voters [incentives](#providing-incentives) from the current epoch.
5. An epoch is a 7-day period. It starts every Thursday at 00:00 UTC and ends Wednesday at 23:59 UTC. Votes, emissions, fees, and incentives are calculated for each epoch.
