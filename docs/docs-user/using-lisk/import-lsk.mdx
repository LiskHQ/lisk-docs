## Importing LSK to Lisk L2
By default, MetaMask doesn't import LSK tokens into a wallet account. 
This means that a holder of LSK has to import the LSK tokens manually to the wallet for different networks.

:::note
Make sure your wallet has been connected to the relevant network, which in this case is either **Lisk Mainnet** or **Lisk Sepolia Testnet**.
For more information, see the relevant information in the [How to Connect Lisk to a Wallet](connecting-to-a-wallet) guide.
