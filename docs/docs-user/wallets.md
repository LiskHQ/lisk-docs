# Wallets
This page provides an overview of wallets that support the LSK token.

A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, app or online service which stores the public and/or private keys to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. 

### Brave Wallet
A crypto wallet built into the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), enabling Brave users to store, manage, grow, and swap their crypto portfolio from a single wallet.

Unlike most crypto wallets, the Brave Wallet does not require extensions; it’s browser-native, reducing security risks and reliance on extra CPU and memory. Users can transact with almost any crypto asset with superior safety and performance, as well as connect with other wallets and Web3 DApps.

Main features:
- **Non-custodial**
- **Integrated in the Brave browser**
- **Compatible with any EVM network**
- **Token Support**: ETH, ERC 20 (including LSK), and ERC 721 (NFTs) support.
