This guide explains ste-by-step how to pause your [locking position](overview#locking-positions) countdown, in order to receive more [voting power](/governance/overview#voting-power) in the Lisk DAO.

:::tip
Pausing your locking position can [boost your voting power](/governance/overview#boosting-the-voting-power) up to **200%**.
:::

1. Go to your [Staking Dashboard](https://portal.lisk.com/staking/dashboard) in the Lisk Portal.
    Connect your wallet if you haven't already.
2. In the list of your locking positions, click on the locking position you wish to pause, to expand it.

    Confirm you understand the consequences of pausing your position by clicking the `Pause Countdown` button.
4. Confirm the action in your wallet.
5. Your locking position will now be paused, and you will see a confirmation message.

If your reload the page, you should see the voting power displayed in the staking dashboard has increased accordingly.

:::note
Your [delegation](/governance/overview#delegation) in the Lisk DAO will automatically be updated to reflect the new voting power.
