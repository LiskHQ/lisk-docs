    You may use the %-Buttons below to conveniently stake a certain percentage of your total LSK balance.
5. **Set the locking period.** <br />
    <img src={duration} /><br />
    By setting the locking period, you define the duration for which your LSK tokens will be staked.
    As long as the tokens are staked, they are locked for any other usage.
6. **Approve the staking by clicking the `Approve` button.** <br />

    Before you can stake your LSK tokens, you need to approve the spending cap for the Staking contract in your wallet.
7. **Create the locking position by clicking the `Stake` button.**<br />
    <img src={stake} width="80%"/><br />
    To complete the staking process, create the locking position with the amount and period defined in the previous steps, by approving the transaction in your wallet.

As you can see on your [Staking Dashboard](https://portal.lisk.com/staking/dashboard), you receive voting power in the Lisk DAO and staking rewards, proportional to your staked amount and locking duration.

In order to use your voting power to participate in the decentralized governance of Lisk, make sure to [Delegate your voting power](/governance/delegation) to yourself or a delegate of your choice.

After at least one day of staking, you should see the accumulated amount of [staking rewards](overview#staking-rewards) that you are eligible for until then.
Check out the next section to learn how to claim your rewards.

## How to claim staking rewards

Staking rewards can be claimed at any time.
When claiming, you can choose to either receive the rewards or re-stake them, increasing your locked amount and thereby boosting your voting power in governance.

1. **Go to the `Claim` tab of the `Stake Tokens` page** on the Lisk Portal:<br />
    ‚Üí https://portal.lisk.com/staking/claim ‚Üê <br />
     **Connect your Lisk wallet** to the Lisk Portal, if you haven't already.
2. **Select the network you want to stake on.** 
    This should be either `Lisk` or `Lisk Sepolia Testnet`.
3. **Click the `Claim Rewards` button.**
4. **Verify your rewards ready to be claimed.**<br />
