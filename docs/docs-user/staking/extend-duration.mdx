This guide explains step-by-step how to extend the duration of the countdown of a particular [locking position](overview#locking-positions).

1. Go to your [Staking Dashboard](https://portal.lisk.com/staking/dashboard) in the Lisk Portal.
    Connect your wallet if you haven't already.
2. In the list of your locking positions, click on the locking position you wish to extend, to expand it.

3. Click on the `Extend Duration` button.
4. Set the amount of weeks you want to extend the countdown of the current locking position.
    <img src={extend} /><br />
    Click on the `Extend Duration` button.
    :::tip
    You can review the new end date of the locking position directly in the prompt.
    Additionally, you can preview the amount of voting power you will gain by extending the locking position duration (voting power will only increase if the position is paused, see [Boosting the voting power](governance/overview#boosting-the-voting-power)).
    :::
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
6. The countdown of the locking position will now be extended by the specified amount of weeks.
