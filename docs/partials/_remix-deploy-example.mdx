## 1. Open Remix

Navigate to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) in your browser.

## 2. Create a new file

Inside the `contracts` folder, click the ðŸ“„ ("Create new file") button to create a new empty Solidity file.
You can name this file whatever you'd like, e.g., `MyNFT.sol`.

## 3. Copy the example contract

Copy the following example contract into your new file to deploy a simple NFT contract, or replace it with your own contract you wish to deploy:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721 {
    uint256 public currentTokenId;

    constructor() ERC721("My NFT", "MNFT") {}

    function mint(address recipient) public returns (uint256) {
        uint256 newItemId = ++currentTokenId;
        _safeMint(recipient, newItemId);
        return newItemId;
    }
}
```

## 4. Compile the contract

Please double-check that the compiler version of the Remix IDE matches the compiler version mentioned in the smart contract: `pragma solidity ^0.8.28;`.

Press the green play button at the top to compile the contract.

## 5. Deploy the contract

Open the `Deploy & run transactions` tab (this looks like an Ethereum logo with an arrow pointing right).
Make sure that your environment is set to "Injected Provider", your wallet is connected to Lisk or Lisk Sepolia network, and Remix has access to your wallet.
Then, select the `MyNFT` contract from the deployment dropdown and click the orange `Deploy` button to deploy the contract and confirm the contract deployment in your connected wallet.

Check the Remix log messages; they should include the contract address.
Paste this address in Blockscout, to see the contract in the Lisk blockchain explorer: https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com/address/0x73e7a94dD5760d862F6FD9f8ea5D4245Bb143446.

In case you chose to deploy on the Lisk Mainnet, you need to paste the address on https://blockscout.lisk.com instead.

## 6. Verify the contract

If you want to interact with your contract on the block explorer, you first need to verify it.
The above contract has already been verified, so you should be able to view your version on a block explorer already.
For the remainder of this guide, we'll walk through how to verify your contract with Remix on the Lisk Sepolia Testnet.

You can apply the same steps for verifying a contract on Lisk Mainnet, in case you deployed it there in the previous step, just use https://blockscout.lisk.com instead of https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com in step 2.

  - In Remix, right-click on the contract you wish to verify and select `Flatten`.
  This will create a new file `MyNFT_flattened.sol`.
  - Now, switch to your [newly deployed contract](https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com/address/0x73e7a94dD5760d862F6FD9f8ea5D4245Bb143446) on https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com/
  - Go to the contract tab and click on the blue `Verify and Publish` button.
    - (Optional) Set a license for your contract.
    - Choose `Solidity (Single file)` as the verification method.
    - Choose the compiler version that fits your contract.
    - Disable code optimization.
    - Copy the flattened source code from Remix and paste it into the `Enter the Solidity Contract Code` field.
  - Check that all info is correct and click the `Verify and Publish` button, to verify your contract.
  
  Once verified, the code tab will include the âœ… icon, and the source code will be viewable.
