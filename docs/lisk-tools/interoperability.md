# Interoperability

## Bridges

For bridging tokens from Lisk to other networks, please check the [Bridges](/docs/docs-user/bridges.mdx) page for an overview of all available bridges.

## ChainLink CCIP
[Chainlink CCIP](https://www.chainlinkecosystem.com/ecosystem/lisk) is a blockchain interoperability protocol that enables developers to build secure applications that can transfer tokens, messages (data), or both tokens and messages across chains. Marking a significant milestone for the Lisk ecosystem.

What this means for you:

- Cross-chain Interoperability: Seamless token and data transfers with 20+ blockchains
- Expanded Liquidity: Access to a larger pool of users and capital
- Security: Backed by Chainlinkâ€™s battle-tested, decentralized oracle network
- Developer Simplicity: Standardized, easy-to-integrate cross-chain infrastructure
- New Use Cases: Enables multi-chain DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and enterprise applications



## LayerZero
With [Layer Zero](https://lisk.com/blog/posts/lisk-x-layerzero-powering-new-cross-chain-capabilities/), protocols can interact seamlessly with other blockchains, opening up endless opportunities for builders and users on Lisk. Additionally, developers on other LayerZero-supported networks can expand their applications to Lisk.

This includes:

- Seamless cross-chain messaging
- Effortless token transfers
- Easy smart contract migration


## Hyperlane

[Hyperlane](https://hyperlane.xyz/) is a blockchain interoperability protocol that allows different blockchains to communicate and share information with each other.
It acts like a "highway" between blockchains, enabling them to send messages, transfer assets, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) across different networks.
This helps improve the connectivity between blockchains, making them more efficient and integrated.
