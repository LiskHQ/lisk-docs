# Embedded wallet providers

This page summarizes providers of embedded wallets that support the Lisk network.

Embedded wallets providers support developers to integrate web3 wallets directly into an application, rather than requiring a separate browser extension or app. They allow users to take action without leaving the host application.

## Panna

The [Panna-SDK](https://github.com/LiskHQ/panna-sdk) is a developer-first toolkit for building seamless, user-friendly decentralized applications. It combines essential Web3 infrastructure with pre-built UI components to help developers create apps that feel like Web2. 

With features like social login wallets (email, Google, phone number), gasless transactions, and fiat onramps, Panna eliminates the typical friction of blockchain onboarding—making Web3 invisible to users while giving developers full control.

## Privy

[Privy](https://www.privy.io/) builds authentication and wallet infrastructure to enable better products built on crypto rails. Get started in minutes to onboard users with wallets, spin up self-custodial wallets for users, and securely sign transactions through your app.

Privy surfaces both user-centric abstractions enabling you to authenticate users and generate wallets for them, as well as wallet-centric abstractions whereby you can create wallets with assigned authorization keys to control them.

## Thirdweb

[Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/wallets) offers wallet Infrastructure to onboard, authenticate, and manage user identity in your application. 

Create wallets for your users with flexible authentication options. Choose from email/phone verification, social OAuth, passkeys, or external wallet connections. Thirdweb supports creation of non-custodial user wallets, as well as server-, external- and ecosystem wallets.

## Xellar

[Xellar](https://xellar.co/) offers a mobile wallet and a devkit for embedded Wallets to be integrated into apps and websites.
Enables users to create wallets with Social Login native to the App.
