# Embedded wallet providers

This page summarizes providers of embedded wallets that support the Lisk network.

Embedded wallet providers support developers to integrate web3 wallets directly into an application, rather than requiring a separate browser extension or app. They allow users to take action without leaving the host application.

## Panna

The [Panna-SDK](https://github.com/LiskHQ/panna-sdk) is a developer-first toolkit for building seamless, user-friendly decentralized applications. It combines essential Web3 infrastructure with pre-built UI components to help developers create apps that feel like Web2. 

Panna is designed to make Web3 app development as smooth and intuitive as possible by offering:

- **Invisible Web3 for users**: abstract away wallets, gas fees, and onboarding complexity
- **Plug-and-play Web3 features**: social login, fiat onramps, and transaction handling
- **Composable React UI components**: rapidly build polished Web3-enabled interfaces

By streamlining both the developer experience and the user journey, Panna enables teams to ship modern, production-ready dApps — without the usual complexity of Web3 development.

## Privy

[Privy](https://www.privy.io/) builds authentication and wallet infrastructure to enable better products built on crypto rails. Get started in minutes to onboard users with wallets, spin up self-custodial wallets for users, and securely sign transactions through your app.

Privy surfaces both user-centric abstractions enabling you to authenticate users and generate wallets for them, as well as wallet-centric abstractions whereby you can create wallets with assigned authorization keys to control them.

## Thirdweb

[Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/wallets) offers wallet Infrastructure to onboard, authenticate, and manage user identity in your application. 

Create wallets for your users with flexible authentication options. Choose from email/phone verification, social OAuth, passkeys, or external wallet connections. Thirdweb supports creation of non-custodial user wallets, as well as server-, external- and ecosystem wallets.

## Metamask embedded wallets

[MetaMask Embedded Wallets](https://docs.metamask.io/embedded-wallets/) (formerly Web3Auth) is a pluggable embedded wallet infrastructure that simplifies Web3 wallet integration and user onboarding. It supports OAuth-based logins and multiple platforms, allowing users to access Web3 applications through familiar authentication methods in under a minute.

Users enjoy seamless onboarding while maintaining full control of their non-custodial wallets, ensuring both convenience and security.

## Xellar

[Xellar](https://xellar.co/) offers a mobile wallet and a devkit for embedded Wallets to be integrated into apps and websites.
Xellar enables users to create wallets with Social Login native to the App.
