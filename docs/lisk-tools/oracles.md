# Oracles

The following Oracle services support Lisk already:

## RedStone

[RedStone](https://redstone.finance/) offers a radically different design of Oracles catering to the needs of modern DeFi protocols.

- Data providers can avoid the requirement of continuous on-chain data delivery
- Allow end users to self-deliver signed Oracle data on-chain
- Use the decentralized Streamr network to deliver signed oracle data to the end users
- Use token incentives to motivate data providers to maintain data integrity and uninterrupted service
- Leverage the Arweave blockchain as cheap and permanent storage for archiving Oracle data and maintaining data providers' accountability

See [this guide](https://docs.redstone.finance/) to learn how to use the RedStone feeds.
