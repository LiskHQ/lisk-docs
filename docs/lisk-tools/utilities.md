# Utilities

A summary of various services available for building on Lisk.

## Account Abstraction

### Safe 
[Safe](https://docs.safe.global) is the account abstraction leader on Ethereum and the EVM with the most secure smart wallet infrastructure and platform.
Safe brings digital ownership of accounts to everyone by building universal and open contract standards for the custody of digital assets, data, and identity.
To create a Safe account with Lisk, connect your wallet to [Lisk](https://safe.optimism.io/welcome?chain=lisk) or [Lisk Sepolia](https://safe.optimism.io/welcome?chain=lisksep) network through the Superchain-Safe portal.

Gelato deployed a small example [react app](https://gelato-raas-aa.web.app/) with a safe-web3auth integration.
The code for this integration can be found on the [gelato-raas-aa-ui](https://github.com/gelatodigital/gelato-raas-aa-ui) repository.

### 1Balance

[1Balance](https://docs.gelato.network/web3-services/1balance) is a unified multi-chain payments system.
1Balance makes it easy for you to pay all of your costs across all the networks that you are using from one single easy-to-manage balance.

In the [gelato-raas-aa](https://github.com/gelatodigital/gelato-raas-aa) repository, you can find a demo implementation for sponsoring the fees with 1Balance or paying the fees with Safe balance.

## Automation
### Web3 Functions

Gelato's [Web3 Functions](https://www.gelato.network/web3-functions) is a powerful automation system designed to streamline and enhance Web3 operations.
Web3 Functions serve as a comprehensive tool, enabling developers to effortlessly set up, manage, and automate their smart contract tasks.

### Web3 Actions
Tenderly's [Web3 Actions](https://docs.tenderly.co/web3-actions/intro-to-web3-actions?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=lisk) are highly configurable monitoring infrastructure, acting as serverless smart contracts backend.

Automate protocol security and maintenance and respond instantly to on-chain events with customizable, real-time alerting and serverless Node.js backends for smart contracts. Automate responses to on-chain events using Web3 Actions, improve your monitoring by setting up invariant monitoring, or even build Tenderly-hosted webhooks with Web3 Actions.

## Interoperability

### Hyperlane

[Hyperlane](https://hyperlane.xyz/) is a blockchain interoperability protocol that allows different blockchains to communicate and share information with each other.
It acts like a "highway" between blockchains, enabling them to send messages, transfer assets, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) across different networks.
This helps improve the connectivity between blockchains, making them more efficient and integrated.

## Randomness

### Gelato VRF
[Gelato VRF](https://www.gelato.network/vrf) (Verifiable Random Function) is a tool designed to provide robust randomness with inherent verifiability.
Create transparent & fair games, NFTs, lotteries, and other onchain applications with distributed randomness.

## Relay Service

### Gelato Relay

Use [Gelato Relay](https://www.gelato.network/relay), to relay your user's transactions on-chain, enabling secure gasless transactions for an ultra-smooth UX for your app.
This allows for a variety of new web3 experiences, as the user can now pay by only signing a message, or their transaction costs can be sponsored by the developer.

## CI/CD

### Tenderly CI/CD Github Action
[Tenderly Github action plugin](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets/ci-cd/github-actions-foundry?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=lisk) enables effortless provisioning of [Virtual TestNets](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=lisk) as smart contracts testing and staging infrastructure.
